# On-Line-Robot
Creating an online robot to send buying or selling requests to avoid falling into long buying and selling queues.

# Note
It should be noted that this robot alone does not reduce the queue, and it must have a high-speed internet to send requests quickly.

## guidance
To use the Selenium library, after running the pip command, you need to download the web page for Selenium and put it in your code folder.
